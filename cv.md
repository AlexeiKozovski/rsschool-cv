## About myself:
I currently live and work in Minsk. I'm 34 years old. I work as an engineer in a design institute. I am engaged in the development of power supply and electric lighting systems.

I have always been interested in programming. Three years ago I decided to change my profession and become a programmer. I started learning the Java programming language. But I had little free time and a lot of work.

Now I am full of energy and determination and ready to dive into learning front-end development. And I will go to the bitter end!

## Skills
* Java Basic

## Code examples
### Codewars Kata: Can we divide it?
Your task is to create the functionisDivideBy to check if an integer number is divisible by both integers a and b.
```
let isDivideBy = (number, a, b) => {
  if (number % a === 0 && number % b === 0) {
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
```
