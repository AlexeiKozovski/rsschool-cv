## About myself:
I currently live and work in Minsk. I'm 34 years old. I work as an engineer in a design institute. I am engaged in the development of power supply and electric lighting systems.

I have always been interested in programming. Three years ago I decided to change my profession and become a programmer. I started learning the Java programming language. But I had little free time and a lot of work.

Now I am full of energy and determination and ready to dive into learning front-end development. And I will go to the bitter end!
